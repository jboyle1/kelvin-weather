## Kelvin Weather Application

### Description

This is a Codecademy exercise that I have recreated in my code editor, added interactivity, and styled. Here is the project description:

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However thereâ€™s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

Convert Kelvin to Celsius.
